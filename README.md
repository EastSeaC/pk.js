## What is PK.js?
PK.js is an open source script set and admin panel for servers running the Persistent Kingdoms module. This script set aims to fulfil the requirements that have presented themselves within the major communities within the EU region, e.g. gear saving, punishment system, IP tracking, etc. As a result, it may not suffice for roleplay or foreign communities that have additional requirements.

By using the best bits of previous admin panels as inspiration and resolving their shortcomings, PK.js aims to be the most powerful script set and admin panel that Persistent Worlds and Persistent Kingdoms has ever seen. Through the use of PK.js' extensive and robust admin panel one should be empowered to run a successful and enjoyable server for the Persistent Kingdoms community!

## PK.js Features
PK.js has many features that make it simple and easy for you to run a Persistent Kingdoms server. Here is a non exhaustive list of the features that allow you to do this:
 * Create Server Tool - Create and configure multiple servers automatically with this simply and easy to use tool.
 * Server Dashboard - A quick way to see what's going on in a server.
 * Server Management Panel - Start, restart, stop and reconfigure server instances without the need for any command line.
 * Server Stats Page - View a wide range of interesting statistics about your server and see how your community and server economy grows over time.
 * Extensive Admin Permission System - Have complete control of what each of your admins can do and track the actions they make with our detailed admin log.
 * Player Info - Search, view and manage player info / saves.
 * Punishment System - Ban, warn and record notes on misbehaving players with ease.
 * IP Tracking Tools - Discover which GUIDs are using the same IP to access the server, create bans that ban all GUIDs associated by IP and view exactly what IPs are being used to access the server. PK.js also provides masking functionality to allow admins to see all this information without being able to access actual IP addresses.
 * Anti Duping Monitoring - Monitor how much gold a player has over time and be able to quickly spot any suspicious increased or decreases in wealth.
 * Log Searching Tool - With immense control and great speed quickly search your server's log files for what you're looking for.
 * Easy Sharing - All pages within the admin panel have unique URLs that allow you to quickly link and share information with other admins.
 * Player Portal - Give players the ability to see what is going on in the server, their save information and their offences from the web panel.
 * And Much more!
 
**PK.js now supports non Persistent Kingdoms modules.** Servers of other modules can be started from the Server Management tab and a custom ban list is provided to allow you to control bans in those modules.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to PK.js, however, please ensure that any contributions fall inline with the aims of PK.js, e.g. please do not make a pull request attempting to add roleplay additions that will not benefit the majority of servers. Before working on large pieces of functionality it is suggested that you make an issue to discuss the changes you intend to make. This will allow you to ensure you do not waste time developing a feature that will not be accepted and will also allow suggestions to be made on the best way to implement these new pieces of functionality.

Please note this project relies on / is split across multiple repositories and contributions may need to be made in other repositories to ensure they are released.
 * [Persistent Kingdoms](https://github.com/OutlawByteStudios/Persistent-Kingdoms) - Anything not directly relating to the scripts (i.e. saving system) or that would benefit those not using PK.js need to be made here. Any client side changes must be made here too, however, please be aware that client side changes are made infrequently.
 * [PK.js Module System](https://github.com/OutlawByteStudios/PK.js-Module-System) - Any changes to the module system relating the scripts (i.e. saving system) must be made in this repository. This repository is a fork of the Persistent Kingdoms repository and any changes made to the original module will be merged here.
 * [Persistent Kingdoms Scene Pack](https://github.com/OutlawByteStudios/PK-Scene-Pack) - Any changes to the scenes must be released in this repository in addition to the PK.js Module System repository.
